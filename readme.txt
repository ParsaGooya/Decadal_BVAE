# Ensemble Generation of Individual Climate Fields Using Variational Autoencoders (VAE)

This repository contains scripts for designing, running, and tuning hyperparameters of simple MLP-based Variational Autoencoder (VAE) models. The implementation also allows the integration of normalized flows for the VAE prior distribution.

**Note:** This repository is intended for internal script sharing and does not include final, cleaned versions of the codes and scripts.

**Deprecated Modules:**  
Please ignore `models.unet` and `models.cnn`, as these are older versions that are no longer updated.
